# terminal
Sharing things I like to use in terminal
I think it's great to alias these scripts in .bash_profile so they can be called like:

alias define="python3 <path>/define_word.py -d"
```
$ define [term]
```
OR
  
alias wiki="python3 <path>/wiki.py -s"
```
$ wiki [term/phrase]
```
Note: Although the wiki script does handle some disambiguation, it's ugly and not perfect.
